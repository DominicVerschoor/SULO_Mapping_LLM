# SULO Mapping with LLM

This repository presents a hybrid pipeline for semantic ontology mapping between the [Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN)](https://sphn.ch) schema and the [SULO](https://w3id.org/sulo) (Simplified Upper-Level Ontology). It supports both forward (SPHN â†’ SULO) and reverse (SULO â†’ SPHN) transformations using Large Language Models (LLMs), SPARQL, and SHACL validation. The pipeline was tested across two SPHN schema versions: `2023.02` and `2025.01`.

Features
-  Bidirectional mapping (SPHN â†’ SULO and SULO â†’ SPHN)
- LLM-guided reasoning via structured prompting and in-context learning
- Schema-agnostic mapping compatible with multiple SPHN versions
- SHACL validation of resulting RDF graphs
- Tkinter GUI for domain expert involvement
- Gradio interface for querying LLMs interactively

ðŸ§ª Usage
ðŸ”¹ LLM Mapping Interface (Gradio)

The LLM processes multi-step instructions and outputs RDF triples mapped to SULO

ðŸ”¹ Manual Mapping Tool (Tkinter GUI)

Provides class/property suggestions and LLM-generated justifications

ðŸ”¹ SPARQL Transformations
Edit and run SPARQL queries from:

mappings/queries/sphn2023_to_sulo.rq

sulo_bidirectionality/sulo_to_sphn_construct.rq

Or test interactively in the Jupyter notebooks provided.

ðŸ”¹ SHACL Validation
Use pySHACL to validate reverse-transformed SPHN RDF graphs:

Datasets & Examples

turtles/sphn_instance_administrativecase_v2025.ttl â€” original SPHN instance

mappings/output/administrative_case_transformed_sulo.ttl â€” SULO-mapped version

sulo_bidirectionality/sulo2sphnv2025.ttl â€” reconstructed SPHN RDF

Experiments & Evaluation
The system was tested on 5 representative SPHN classes:

AdministrativeCase, Allergy, DrugPrescription, ProblemCondition, Diagnosis

Each class was mapped from both SPHN 2023.02 and 2025.01 to SULO using SPARQL queries guided by LLM-inferred relations. Reverse mappings and SHACL validation were used to ensure semantic integrity.
